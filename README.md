# Azure Redis Cache sample
This repository contains source code for WPF client of Azure Redis Cache service for chatting demonstration in pub-sub model. 

Our project currently holds a WPF application, with StackExchange.Redis package as the service providing us the capability to connect to Azure Redis Cache service. You can use this app as a demo, because it doesn't contain much features right now.
